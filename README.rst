faultSlip
======================

A personal python package to preform static earthquake slip inversion of geodetic dataset with inversion condtion number optimization. 

faultSlip can handel one or more of the following data sets:
----------------------------------
* InSAR (raster displacment data set in the line of sight of the satelite)
* optical and SAR pixel corelation (raster displacment data set in tow perpendicular horizontal directions)
* GNSS data (tabular displacment data)
* strain data (GNSS derivved strain data)
